# Client Guide

Use this repo as the neutral starting point for a future client clone.

Basic workflow:

1. Clone this starter.
2. Configure public env vars for live mode.
3. Verify the baseline against the current platform-compatible runtime.
4. Add client-specific design work only through the future client boundary once it exists.

Live-mode env:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSERBISYO_API_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_EVENT_SLUG`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DESIGN_MODE=false`

Rules for future client clones:

- keep the platform data layer untouched
- keep `src/lib/public-event-api.ts`, `src/lib/normalize-public-event.ts`, `src/lib/platform-render-model.ts`, and `src/types/public-event.ts` unchanged unless a platform contract update requires it
- use real platform data instead of hardcoded event content in the reusable baseline
- keep Dashboard/Event Website section order as the source of truth
- render custom sections from the ordered enabled `event.sections` list or the platform render-context section list
- do not hardcode section order unless a client-specific exception is explicitly approved
- do not render disabled sections
- keep nav links derived from enabled sections or constrained to valid rendered anchors only
- keep homepage RSVP behavior config-driven on `/`
- keep `#rsvp` and `#rsvp-form`
- support clone-local `/rsvp` as the dedicated custom RSVP page
- do not add iframe RSVP
- do not wire fake RSVP submit or fake success behavior
- do not expose hidden origin URLs as public guest URLs

Deployment note:

- the hidden Vercel origin is an implementation detail
- the platform/Super Admin will connect that hidden origin later
- guests should continue to use the public WebSerbisyo guest domain, not the hidden deployment URL

Phase 1 note:

- `src/client/` is planned as the future safe customization boundary
- this phase only documents that direction; it does not implement it yet

## Phase 2 client boundary

- `src/client/` now exists as the future customization zone
- it is inert by default
- future client clones should start with `src/client/client.config.ts`
- do not expect runtime visual changes from Phase 2 alone
- runtime hooks and override mechanisms are deferred to a later phase

## Phase 3 wrapper hook

- `src/client/` is now imported at the page-shell level only
- the active runtime still remains `src/app/page.tsx` -> `src/components/platform/PublicEventPageContent.tsx` -> `src/components/platform/EventWebsiteRenderer.tsx`
- default visual output remains unchanged because `layout.navEnabled` and `layout.footerEnabled` are both `false`
- this phase does not add section overrides
- this phase does not change RSVP behavior
- future phases may safely enable config-driven nav/footer first before any section-override work

## Dashboard Section Order Contract

- Dashboard/Event Website section order is the source of truth.
- Custom client renderers must respect the ordered enabled platform section list.
- Custom layout is allowed inside `src/client/`, but order and enabled/disabled behavior must remain platform-driven.
- Custom clones may change cards, grids, spacing, animation, and section presentation under `src/client/`.

Safe renderer pattern:

```tsx
const orderedSections = event.sections.filter((section) => section.enabled);

return orderedSections.map((section) => {
  const renderSection = sectionRenderers[section.key];
  if (!renderSection) return null;
  return <Fragment key={section.key}>{renderSection(section)}</Fragment>;
});
```

## Phase 4 optional nav/footer

- `src/client/client.config.ts` now supports config-driven nav/footer scaffolding
- defaults remain disabled, so the base starter output remains unchanged
- nav links should stay on local anchors such as `#top`, `#venue`, and `#rsvp`
- homepage RSVP may stay inline, compact, or CTA-only
- use `/rsvp` for the dedicated custom RSVP page
- do not add redirect or embedded RSVP flows
- multi-page routing is still deferred

## Phase 5 page-level client renderer

- the starter now includes a page-level client renderer switch in `src/client/client.config.ts`
- the default remains `renderer.mode = "platform"` with `allowClientRenderer = false`
- base starter output remains unchanged by default
- `src/components/platform/EventWebsiteRenderer.tsx` remains protected
- section-level slot overrides are still deferred
- future cloned client repos may opt into a custom client renderer after cloning, using real event data only

## Phase 6 library protocol

- client UI libraries should be organized under `src/client/libs/`
- use wrapper hubs where practical, especially for icons
- `lucide-react` is already installed and may be used through `@/client/libs/icons`
- shadcn, Framer Motion, and ReactBits-style libraries are documented for clones only and are not installed in the neutral starter
- see `docs/LIBRARY_PROTOCOL.md` and `docs/CLONE_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md`

## Final clone workflow

1. Set env vars.
2. Confirm platform data loads.
3. Decide whether to enable the client renderer in the clone.
4. Add UI libraries only under `src/client/libs` or approved `src/client` paths.
5. Customize `src/client` only.
6. Test at `375px`, `768px`, and `1280px`.
7. Verify `#rsvp` and `#rsvp-form`.
8. Run validation.
9. Deploy the hidden Vercel origin.
10. Set the platform custom frontend origin URL in Super Admin later.

## Website QR and RSVP QR Contract

- Website QR opens the full clean public website URL.
- RSVP QR opens the dedicated custom `/rsvp` URL when the clone supports it.
- Fallback website URL remains `/r/[slug]`.
- Fallback RSVP URL remains the official platform `/r/[slug]/rsvp`.
- Do not revive `/r/[slug]/rsvp/embed`.
- Do not use iframe RSVP.
- Do not fake RSVP success.
- Do not bypass the official platform validation contract.

Responsiveness note:

- use `docs/RESPONSIVENESS.md`
- use `src/client/responsive.ts`
- test enabled client nav, footer, renderer, and any library-driven UI after clone customization
